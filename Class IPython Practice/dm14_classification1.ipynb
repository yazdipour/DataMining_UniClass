    "scikit-learn provides various functions for evaluating the accuracy of a model. We're using the F1 score for each fold, which we then average together for a mean accuracy on the entire set. Using the model we just built and the example data sets mentioned in the beginning of this tutorial, we get about 0.94. A confusion matrix helps elucidate how the model did for individual classes. Out of 55,326 examples, we get about 178 false spams, and 3,473 false hams. I say \"about\" because by shuffling the data as we did, these numbers will vary each time we run the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's really not bad for a first run. Obviously it's not production-ready even if we don't consider the scaling issues. Consumers demand accuracy, especially regarding false spams. Who doesn't hate to lose something important to the spam filter?"

    "In order to get better results, there's a few things we can change. We can try to extract more features from the emails, we can try different kinds of features, we can tune the parameters of the naïve Bayes classifier, or try another classifier all together.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to get more features is to use n-gram counts instead of just word counts. So far we've relied upon what's known as \"bag of words\" features. It's called that because we simply toss all the words of a document into a \"bag\" and count them, disregarding any meaning that could locked up in the ordering of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "An n-gram can be thought of as a phrase that is n words long. For example, in the sentence \"Don't tase me, bro\" we have the 1-grams, \"don't,\" \"tase,\" \"me,\" and \"bro.\" The same sentence also has the 2-grams (or bigrams) \"don't tase\", \"tase me\", and \"me bro.\" We can tell CountVectorizer to include any order of n-grams by giving it a range. For this data set, unigrams and bigrams seem to work well. 3-grams add a tiny bit more accuracy, but for the computation time they incur, it's probably not worth the marginal increase."

    "That boosts the model up to an F1 score of about 0.98. As before, it's a good idea to keep an eye on how it's doing for individual classes and not just the set as a whole. Luckily this increase represents an increase for both spam and ham classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to improve accuracy is to use different kinds of features. N-gram counts have the disadvantage of unfairly weighting longer documents. A six-word spammy message and a five-page, heartfelt letter with six \"spammy\" words could potentially receive the same \"spamminess\" probability. To counter that, we can use frequencies rather than occurances. That is, focusing on how much of the document is made up of a particular word, instead of how many times the word appears in the document. This kind of feature set is known as term frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to converting counts to frequencies, we can reduce noise in the features by reducing the weight for words that are common across the entire corpus. For example, words like \"and,\" \"the,\" and \"but\" probably don't contain a lot of information about the topic of the document, even though they will have high counts and frequencies across both ham and spam. To remedy that, we can use what's known as inverse document frequency or IDF.\n",
